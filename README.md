Journal for 8-1


The project is a simple clock setter. It makes the base line of formating a clock and being able to change the time. It has a basic function for adding time that will be useful when trying to make it automated. I did a good job with the readibility. I explained each function and made sure there was a comment explaining everything. I also ensured there was a proper spacing to ensure readability.

The projects goal was to help intoduce us to the concept of making a designing classes of anj object oriented language. It was difficult at first making sure all the variables were safe and getting the loop to work. I used best practices taught with the class to ensure that the vairables were safe. I had to decide what variables needed to be accesable easily or what had to be set with a function. I got the loop to work by trial and error. Debuging skills is great for making sure programs are working. I made a bunch of print statements through out the functions to ensure I could see how to program was running. The debugging, the formating, and best practice with variables helped make it easier for me to design and debug my next projects.
